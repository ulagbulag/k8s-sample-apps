# Sample K8S Templates for Ulagbulag

We are collecting K8S templates that we can use at our convenience. The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide as many of the publicly available Kubernetes templates we use as possible in one place. These templates enable rapid bootstrapping and rapid PoC of the k8s development environment. This can be conveniently indexed via LAG, etc., and we recommend this.

Please note that the templates we provide here are different from our actual operating environment. We verify templates with our own security solutions, but the results are not immediately reflected here. Be sure to seek help from a DevOps expert when applying the template in a production environment. Please refer to the license file in the repository for more details.
